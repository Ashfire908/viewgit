[Milestones]
- Public Launch (0.0.1?)
	- a public demo
	- must have a minimalistic but useful interface
	- must have features planned as mandatory
	- should be at least able to rival other similar projects (the PHP ones at least)
	- validate generated pages

	- sourceforge project
	- website, tracked with Google Analytics
	- freshmeat project page
	- post link to <http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb>
	- announce on git list
	- announce on viewsvn's news section
	- link from viewsvn's page
- First fixes & new features based on feedback (0.0.2)

[features]
- ideas in nutshell
	- free git repository viewer that is easy to install and does not have many dependencies
	- depends: PHP5, git
- mandatory features (0.0.1)
	- project list (configurable or from a root, using globs perhaps?)
		- name, description (.git/description), action links
	- tar.gz snapshots of trees
	- shortlog
	- root dir, under which all directories are shown on viewgit
	- tree browsing / downloading of individual files
- optional
	- RSS feeds: projects, shortlog
	- branches list?
	- tag list
- don't mimic gitweb interface as it's a tad clunky

[misc]
- name?
	- ViewGit
		- 3 google hits, none of a project
		- Not registered at: SourceForge, Freshmeat, BerliOS

- license?
	- GPLv2 vs. GPLv3 vs. AGPLv3
	- add clarification that linking to the original homepage is enough to provide source, as long as it's around
	- when decided, state in the commit log that it holds retroactively for earlier commits?

- bundle about page that says what the software is and where to download it

- other projects?
	- <http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb>

[low priority]
- commit: option to hide/scramble the e-mail
- archive: use ob_start/ob_length/ob_flush for creating archives so that Content-Length can be sent
