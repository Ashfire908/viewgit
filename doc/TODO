- bundle about page that says what the software is and where to download it

- summary: limit number of tags shown, add a separate page for all tags (eg. wine)

- geshi support (check compatiblity with AGPLv3)?

- should be possible to link to a path at HEAD without the need for a tree hash
	- tree: "Browse this tree at HEAD" -link

[Milestones]
- Public Launch (0.0.1?)
	- a public demo
	- must have a minimalistic but useful interface
	- must have features planned as mandatory
	- should be at least able to rival other similar projects (the PHP ones at least)
	- validate generated pages

	- sourceforge project
	- website, tracked with Google Analytics
		- Google Analytics
		- Piwik
		- Link to other projects at <http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb>
	- freshmeat project page
	- post link to <http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb>
	- announce on git list
	- announce on viewsvn's news section
	- link from viewsvn's page
- First fixes & new features based on feedback (0.0.2)

[low priority]
- diff between arbitrary trees/commits
- commitdiff page: filename list has no action links
- commit support / uploading of bundles to be reviewed
- pagenav loses track of which branch/tag we are viewing
- checkout: generate git-update-server-info information on-the-fly if needed?
- disable error reporting by default, and use own error handler for debug mode
- full log page
- summary: show [MASTER] and so on if the given commit is a tag or a head
