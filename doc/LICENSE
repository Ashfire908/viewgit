ViewGit is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License version 3, see the
agpl-3.0.txt file.

Contributions
=============

Contributions should be sent under "AGPLv3 or older" to allow me to upgrade the
license later on.

Complying with the license
==========================

NOTE: This is just an interpretation - you still need to follow the license.

Shortly put, compared to GPLv3, AGPLv3 requires you to share any modifications
you make to the source with any network users who use your copy of the
software.

[ this naturally excludes inc/localconfig.php which is not part of the software,
just a configuration file - at least as long as you use it for that purpose only. ]

Simple way to comply with this requirement is to "git clone" the whole ViewGit
history, and commit your changes on top of the history. Then you can publish
the .git directory using ViewGit itself.
